# FrankenChat

#### MERN stack + Socket.io. Full stack chat application with CRUD functionality and Socket.io for user presence. 
1. Clone repository
2. $ npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..
3. $ yarn start:dev

#### Known Issues
1. The Socket.IO implementation is not complete and is presently looping connects/disconnects. It runs fine for a quick demo but degrades quickly.
2. The Bootstrap implemtation was done quickly and should be refactored.
3. This app is NOT responsive and should be viewed on a desktop device.

#### Why FrankenChat?
It's a hodgepodge of features to demo CRUD functionality with a bit of websocket to show user presence. It leans more toward Slack than traditional chat.
